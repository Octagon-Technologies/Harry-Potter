# Harry Potter || Characters
![Poster - Harry Potter](https://github.com/Octagon-Technologies/Harry-Potter/assets/62815445/d6516c1a-3e12-49f1-840d-8eb7c390a62c)

An app that displays Harry Potter characters and details about them.

## Technologies used:
- Kotlin: Programming language
- Jetpack Compose: Language for the UI
- Koin: Dependency Injection
- Retrofit: Online data fetching
- Room: Local persistence
- MVVM: Architecture model

## Enhancements from initial app:
- Offline persistence
- Use of `NetworkConnectivity` to make network calls once the device goes online
- Use of Tabs in Compose which low-key look better-ish :)
- Splash Screen API intergration
- Light and Dark mode compatibility

## Areas not yet done:
- The House card e.g Gryfindorr ~ Didn't find this info on the API (might need a bit more research)... Plus, there's this animation that Annie has added on the house logo which looks pretty cool {I'll need to check out animations in Compose to add that on the app}
- We've not yet perfect the positioning of the character image in the details screen... Do more research on `Modifier.fillMaxWidth()` as well as `Modifier.aspectRatio()`

Nonetheless, I'm not sure what else to add in the README so..... have a blast, I guess :>
